### Type Hierarchy

`supertype(T)` -> Parent on Type Tree

`subtypes(T)` -> All Children on Type Tree

`methods(+)` -> *every* method that exists for `+`

`methods(+,(Integer,Integer))` -> every method for adding two integers

### Note: Ensure that you read the *stable* docs, and that you are using v0.6.1.
