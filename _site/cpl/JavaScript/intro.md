# Introduction to JavaScript


## JavaScript in the Browser

JavaScript is sent to the browser from a server, and the *browser* is responsible
for executing it.


## JavaScript is a Strange Language

### created in May 1995 by Brandan Eich as Mocha
    - created in 10 days while working for Netscape
    - went on to co-found Mozilla
    - now working on Brave


###  Others wanted in
  - Microsoft made JScript
  - Netscape had livescript
standardization was becoming an issue quickly

## ECMAScript
ECMAScript is the language specification designed to solve these issues.
The latest version is 8 (ECMAScript 2017).

(everyone things the name sucks)

Implementations try to adhere to the standard, but may implement their own features.


## Implementaitons

Firefox has SpiderMonkey


Chrome has V8, which is also the core of Node.js


Internet Explorer has Chakra.



## Why Do We Care?
Why is JavaScript as prevalent as it is now?

Primarily for two reasons:


1. it capitalized at the right time
2. it provided interactivity within the browser


## What it's used for

+ Client-side scripting(browsers)

+ Server-side scripting(Node.js)


## Specifications for CPL
We will use Node.js 6.11.3 server-side and Firefox client-side.

We will adhere to the [Google JavaScript Style Standard](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)
